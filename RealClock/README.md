# Stardew Valley Real-Time Clock Mod

Hey there! üåü Welcome to the Real-Time Clock Mod for Stardew Valley!

This mod enhances the gameplay experience by updating the in-game clock every single minute instead of every 10 minutes, making time feel more dynamic and realistic.

## Description

Ever wished time flowed more naturally in Stardew Valley? With this mod, you'll notice that the clock changes every minute (game time) instead of waiting around for 10 minutes to pass. This small tweak enhances immersion and adds a touch of realism to your gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Frequent Clock Updates:** Experience the passage of time more realistically with the game clock updating every minute.
- **Customizable Settings:** Tailor the mod to your liking with three configurable options:
  - **Enabled:** Toggle the mod on or off based on your preferences.
  - **SecondsToMinutes:** Adjust how quickly time progresses. By default, it mirrors the game's original speed, but you can tweak it to match your desired pace.
  - **Show24Hours:** Choose between a 24-hour clock format or stick with the classic 12-hour display.
